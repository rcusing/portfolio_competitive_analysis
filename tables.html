                <li>Professional:
                The serif typeface and exclusive use of black and grey
                indicates formality and seriousness.</li>
                <li>Muted: The background color is not pure white but somewhat
                greyish. The text is small and unobtrusive, almost blending
                into the background but not quite.
                </li>
                <li>Direct: His work is front and center, unadorned. The
                descriptions below are short and to the point.

            Overall, the page gives me the impression that this is a person
            who is proud of his work and confident in his ability to deliver,
            but reluctant to say too much or be overly showy or flashy.

            <td><p>Although concise, he provides enough information about
            himself to get an idea of his background, linking to external
            sites for those who need more as well as providing his contact
            information in a visually salient position.</p>
            <p>However, it is unclear that the slideshow is only a teaser,
            showing only 5 sample images from a total of 12 different projects,
            each with multiple images.</p>
            <p>The gallery page features thumbnail images representing the
            different projects, which gives a striking look. Hovering over the
            image washes out the color and shows 2 lines of text with the
            name of the client and type of work, linking to an individual
            page for that particular project with more images and description.
            The concise labels and descriptions in this case makes the
            information rather vague and lacking in detail.</p>
            <p>The project page has the same layout as the main page, but
            instead of an automatic slideshow, he includes some grey circles
            under the word "Images" at the bottom right, with one circle
            blacked in for the current image. It may not be immediately
            apparent that the images will not change on their own, but
            the layout is simple enough that it's not a huge problem.</p></td>

            over the thumbnail does not do the trick, in which case the viewer
            needs to click on the image. Individual project pages feature a

            the about page. Same issue with the gallery page, especially
            because clicking around the text rather than directly on the text
            does not lead anywhere.</td>

            generation." The page headlines zoom in from off-screen. The
            background images are blurred, implying motion. This is a
            company that is on the move.</li>
            <li>Involved: The examples of blog post titles demonstrate
            community involvement ("Help us donate") and an interest in
            joining the discussion about topics related to digital
            marketing.</li>
            <li>Informal: Still professional, but not so straight-laced. Sans-
            serif typeface, subtle use of color amidst mostly white on black
            text. Informal style of writing and limited use of capital letters. 
            </li>    
            </ul>
            
            Overall, I get the impression that this is a marketing agency
            with people who not only know what they're doing and are up on
            all the latest, but they are also going to be really fun to work
            with.</td>

            stands out next to the color of the background image, but it
            doesn't detract from the dramatic effect of the background image.
            </p>
            <p>They give enough information to figure out what they do, how
            they do it, and how to reach them. I like that the phone numbers
            are emphasized. Clicking on the logos on the gallery page
            leads to an individual project page, with a sample image and text
            description of what they did.</p>
            <p>However, the main page itself is not particularly revealing.
            It seems like just a portal/entryway to give an impression of the
            brand.</p>

            somewhat hectic transitions (same effect on the gallery page, but
            less hectic). A form for messages on the contact page. Clicking

            <p>It may be fairly natural to click on the thumbnails on the
            main page or gallery page, but a lot would be lost on the off-
            chance that the opportunity was missed. When you make it to
            the project presentation/slideshow, there are nice big left
            and right arrows to indicate that you can continue looking
            at different projects. However, no indication of how many pages
            there are or what's coming up next.</td>

            little bit of color here and there. His logo designs are
            similarly clean and simple, but elegantly centered over a slightly
            grey rectangle.</li>
            <li>Approachable: He provides multiple invitations and ways to
            contact him across the site. Informal language with helpful
            advice directed at potential clients, seemingly with the intention
            of putting the interests of the clients first.

            Overall, I get the impression that this is a small-scale operation,

            do good work.
